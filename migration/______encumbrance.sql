This agent must have the authority to nullify the encumbrance.
This agent may act in an advisory role; final authority to remove encumbrances rests with the collection.


Specimens under encumbrances which no one has the authority to remove should be considered for de-accession. Encumbrances assigned by persons who cannot be contacted should be removed.

Expiration Date and/or Event:....
- new paragraph:

Expiration Date: All encumbrances should be temporary. De-accession should be considered for permanently-encumbered specimens. Expiration date may occur no more than 5 years from the current date. Yearly email notifications are provided to 
collection staff, and encumbrances may be extended (in 5-year increments) indefinitely. Expiration date is a triggering event - encumbrances are automaticaly retracted when expiration_date is reached.
